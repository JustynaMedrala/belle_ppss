===================
  EventInfoSetter
===================
Description: Sets the event meta data information (exp, run, evt). You must use this module to tell basf2 about the number of events you want to generate, unless you have an input module that already does so. Note that all experiment/run combinations specified must be unique.
Package:     framework

                                                        number) occurs. This
                                                        parameter is useful for
                                                        debugging to start with
                                                        a specific event.


===============
  EvtGenInput
===============
Description: EvtGenInput module. The module is served as an interface for EvtGen Event Generator so that the EvtGen generator can store the generated particles into MCParticles. The users need to provide their own decay mode based on the standard DECAY.DEC.
